                        `Struct` represents a structured data value, consisting of fields
                        which map to dynamically typed values. In some languages, `Struct`
                        might be supported by a native representation. For example, in
                        scripting languages like JS a struct is represented as an
                        object. The details of that representation are described together
                        with the proto support for the language.


                        The JSON representation for `Struct` is JSON object.

                              `Value` represents a dynamically typed value which can be either
                              null, a number, a string, a boolean, a recursive struct value, or a
                              list of values. A producer of value is expected to set one of these
                              variants. Absence of any variant indicates an error.


                              The JSON representation for `Value` is JSON value.
